### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Storage API | MDN docs site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) - This helped me to saved the score value and use it when the user visit again the game website. It is a tutorial from the MDN docs, It has some examples that help me to understand how to use the Storage API.
- [DOMContentLoaded | MDN docs site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event) - This is the document event docs. It is good to learn how this event works. I used it for updating the score when the page is reload or first loaded.
